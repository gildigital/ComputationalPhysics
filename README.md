# 371st Conquest

Feel free to take my logic but not my words! Be cool and rewrite everything in your own style.

Download the repository to your github manager. If you're using visual studio, this is in `Git -> Clone Repository`.

Plug-in the repository URL, which you can get by going to `<code>` above and clicking `Local -> Clone -> HTTPS`.

Perform changes in your desktop environment and commit your changes with a style like this:

```
# -------50--------character--------heading------ (or more :))
Add change to class

# Followed by an empty line then the body
## What changed and why?
- Fixed logic because...

## How was the change tested?
- Output was verified...
```

Then push your change!
